How do I approach designing software?

In this project, I crafted an OpenGL scene that accurately recreates a photo with multiple objects. My design process involved using various objects, adding movement and lighting, and applying textures to bring the scene to life. This approach can be applied to future projects to create precise and realistic images using OpenGL.
Developing Programs

How do I approach developing programs?

During development, I focused on version control and experimenting with new features while ensuring I always had a working version to fall back on. Iterating and adding features continuously helped me build confidence in OpenGL and expand my understanding of how to apply new concepts effectively.
Reaching Goals with Computer Science

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science equips me with essential problem-solving skills and logical thinking, crucial for achieving both educational and career goals. Computational graphics and visualizations enhance my ability to represent complex data visually, making me more adept at tackling technical challenges and developing visually-driven software and applications.
